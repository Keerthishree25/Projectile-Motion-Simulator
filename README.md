Projectile Motion Simulator is implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input initial velocity and launch angle to simulate the trajectory of a projectile, both visually on a canvas and graphically using Chart.js. The simulation calculates the projectile's path considering gravity and displays it in real-time.
